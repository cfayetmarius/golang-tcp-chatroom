Welcome to the client of olc tcp chatroom.
To use this client is pretty easy just type :
'client.exe <IP> <PORT>'
Where IP is an IPV4 adress and PORT is a valid port. Olc servers usually run on port 9000, at least it is the default port.
Once you are connected to a room, a nickname like member_12 is given to you. 
To change your nickanme in the room just type (once you are connected to it) :
/nick <nickname>
Where nickname is between 4 and 16 characters and only contains "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890_"
If you want to nick automatically just type :
/nick
And the room will give you your default nickname (which one you can modify in the settings.txt). By default, your default nickname might be John_Galt.
To get some help type client.exe help.
