Welcome to olc server README file !
Right now, it implements :

-Renaming members (and handling two same-named members, by adding a 'bis' after the nick)

-Handling a number of chatters in the room

-Automatically removing connections when a member leaves

-Blocking IPs from blacklist.txt file

-Comunicating the name of the server to the client

And in the future, the project might include :

-Encryption of the chat (probably only encrypt it with a simple protocol)
